          <h3>I have found a pet I am interested in. Now what?</h3>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Congratulations! Your next step is to contact the organization listed
          on the pet’s page. Click “learn more about me” to go to
          Adopt-a-Pet.com for additional information on the shelter or rescue
          and its adoption process.
        </p>
        <strong>
          <h3>Will I be able to take my pet home immediately?</h3>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Usually, yes. Sometimes you’ll have to wait for the pet to be spayed
          or neutered.
        </p>
        <strong>
          <h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
        </strong>
        <p>
          While some pets are free, adoption fees commonly range between $25 and
          $250. If you feel the cost is too high, ask what it’s based on. Was
          the pet with a rescue group that receives no outside funding, pays for
          all veterinary care, spay/neuter, training, housing, etc. out of their
          own pockets? Did the pet have extraordinary expenses, such as costly
          medical care, before being made available for adoption?
        </p>
        <strong>
          <h3>What happens if there are problems when I get my pet home?</h3>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Some shelters and rescue groups have free or discounted services, such
          as dog-training classes or veterinary or behavior assistance, to make
          sure your adoption goes smoothly after you get your new pet home.
          Rescue groups usually provide a lot of follow-up to adoptions, and
          some shelters do as well. If you’re having health, behavior or
          adjustment problems with your new pet, call your adoption location and
          ask if they have any services that can help things work out!
        </p>
        <strong>
          <h3>
            After my pet has settled in and we’re loving each other – what do I
            do next?
          </h3>
        </strong>
        <p>
          Studies have shown that people are three times more likely to go to a
          shelter or rescue group if they talk to someone else who has. So your
          next step is to tell the world about your wonderful pet, and where you
          found him or her! And, of course, to live happily ever after!
